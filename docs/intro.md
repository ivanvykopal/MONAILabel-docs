# Introduction

## Getting Started

**MONAILabel Server** represents a significant advancement in the realm of medical image analysis, not only expanding the capabilities of the **MONAILabel** platform but also integrating seamlessly with **QuPath**, a prominent image analysis software. This extension now equips researchers and medical professionals with a comprehensive solution for accurate and automated segmentation of critical structures, including **blood vessels**, **inflammation** regions, and **endocardium**, within Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) data obtained after cardiac rejection, stained with H&E or SRel. With the combined power of MONAILabel and QuPath, users can leverage cutting-edge AI models to streamline their analysis workflow, expedite cardiac rejection detection, and drive further insights in the field of digital pathology.

### What you'll need

To utilize MONAILabel Server effectively, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- **Python** or **Docker** installed,

- **Cuda Toolkit** at least v11.2,

- **QuPath** at least v0.4.0,

- **GPU with CUDA support** (This prerequisite is not supported on computers witn macOS).

### Minimal requirements

Minimum hardware requirements:

- 8GB CPU RAM

- Graphics card supporting CUDA - [list](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)

- Graphics card with a minimum of 2GB memory

## MONAILabel Server

**MONAILabel Server** is a project born from the collaboration between Ivan Vykopal's Master thesis at the Faculty of Informatics and Information Technology (FIIT), Slovak University of Technology (STU), and Tomáš Matejov's Bachelor thesis. The server serves the specific purpose of aiding in the identification of cardiac allograft rejection. Additionally, this initiative was undertaken in close collaboration between medical professionals from the Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine (IKEM) and students and researchers from FIIT STU.
